Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets using machine learning techniques. The model classifies transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

Project Overview
Fraud detection is a critical task in financial systems, where detecting malicious behavior early can save millions. This project uses a credit card transaction dataset to build a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit card holders. The dataset includes features such as the transaction amount, timestamp, and whether the transaction was flagged as fraudulent or not.

Class 0: Legitimate transaction
Class 1: Fraudulent transaction
The dataset used for this analysis can be found here.

Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
Project Steps
Data Loading and Exploration

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Basic exploratory analysis such as displaying the first few rows, checking for missing values, and understanding the class distribution.
Data Preprocessing

Separation of legitimate and fraudulent transactions for further analysis.
Statistical analysis of different features in the dataset, such as the transaction amount for both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Modeling

The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A Logistic Regression model is built to classify transactions.
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy.
Results

Accuracy score and other metrics are calculated to assess the model's ability to detect fraud.
Future Work
Experiment with more complex models such as Random Forests or Neural Networks.
Perform further data balancing techniques to improve model performance on the minority class (fraudulent transactions).
